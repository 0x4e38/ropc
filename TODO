const:
    used for
	var = immediate
    to avoid generating
	*&var = immediate
    var is just defined to be immediate
    useful inside loops

volatile:
    used for
	x = var
    to force generating
	x = *&var
    instead of just inlining var
    needed when a variable is used before and after a function call

therefore
    "const volatile" is perfectly ok :)

make [[stack]] attribute and warn if not used in loops
    or warn if automatically added
right now, it is automatically added in loop

allow direct	a = execve
merge is_symbol_constant with get_symbol_flags
    i know is_symbol_constant checks for existence of symbol, but at the time of checking this,
	we already know the symbol exists

__FILE__ and __LINE__ is not supported by the compiler, but you can use the preprocessor

if a gadget modifies SP from R7 (esp from ebp), we must make sure R7 (ebp) is properly initialized
